# üê∂ Pupcloud v0.1.1

Put your files on the web!

Point pupcloud to a local folder and instantly get its contents exposed as a web
application. Browse, manage, share files... _without a database_!

Pupcloud aims to be as simple as possible, while retaining all the features you
would like it to have. It doesn't need a database, or a particular installation
procedure. Just execute it and be done. In due time, it will have:

- Authentication;
- File sharing;
- File operations (delete/copy/move...);
- Everything that fits in a pup-sized cloud ;-)

[Demo here](https://pupcloud-8a4ymrr0t-me-germanorizzo.vercel.app/)

## Basic usage

Pupcloud is distributed as a single executable file. Download and unpack the
proper file for your OS/arch.

Once done, just execute it with the directory to serve as an argument:

```bash
pupcloud -r /my/dir
```

Then, open `http://localhost:17178` with a browser. As simple as that!

Execute `pupcloud -h` to see the other configuration options. For now you can:

- specify a title/brand for the window;
- specify a different port;
- bind to a network interface.

## Supported file types for viewing

In the file system view, you can click on a file to open it. Currently pupcloud
supports:

- Images
- Audio
- Video
- PDF documents (for desktop browsers)
- Text-like files (txt, html, sources...)

Detection of file types is done by mime type, and viewing relies on the
browser's capabilities... that are fairly complete, truth to be told.

## Known bugs

- In rare cases, MIME type detection is wrong. It relies on Go builtin
  functions, so it needs to be investigated more.
- In list view, the menu trigger (`...`) is rendered over the menu itself.
  Waiting for upstream fix.
